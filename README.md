# UFOs

## Project Overview

Dana has requested assistance with building her website. The website is intended to display reported UFO sightings, and allow for users to filter the reports by various criteria. She has also requested step by step instructions for how users will interact with the webpage and its data. 

## Results

### Step 1

The user can enter single or multiple filter terms. Upon pressing 'Enter' the table of data will update with the results. The filtered table can then be further refined by adding additional filters.

To clear the filter inputs and reset the data table, click the UFO Sighting link in the NavBar.

## Summary

A drawback of the current design for the webpage is that the user will need to already know what filter values to use in order to filter the table. This may result in the user having to inefficiently review the table as a whole to identify the desired values to filter by. This could be addressed in a number of ways. For higher level filters like Country or State a dropdown menu could be utilized. Other filters like city could use predictive text on the input field to propose possible filter values to the user. 

There are also a number of quality of life update that can be done to make the webpage more user friendly. First, additional filter could be added such as for duration or a keyword search of the comments. Secondly, a 'Clear Filter' button should be added below the filters so that the user does not need to scroll all the way back to the to of the page to reset the filter fields.
