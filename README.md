To clear the filter inputs and reset the data table click the UFO Sighting link in the NavBar.

## Summary

- drawback: you have to already know the value you intend to filter by. This could be addressed by inclusing drop downs for higher level filters like country and state. 

- updates: additional filtering options such as by duration or by keyword in the comments field
- updates: a clear filter button below filters for ease of user
